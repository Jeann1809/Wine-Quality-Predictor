This project uses the **Red Wine Quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to build a machine learning model that predicts wine quality based on physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol.  

---

## üìä Dataset  
- **Source:** [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)  
- **Records:** 1,599 red wine samples  
- **Features:** 11 physicochemical attributes (e.g., fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol)  
- **Target:** Quality score (0‚Äì10) assigned by wine experts  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow  
1. Data preprocessing & cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection & scaling  
4. Model training (classification/regression approaches)  
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)  

---

## üß† Machine Learning Models  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Neural Networks (optional, depending on your notebook)  

---

## üöÄ Results  
The model predicts wine quality with reasonable accuracy and highlights the influence of **alcohol, sulphates, and acidity** as key factors.
